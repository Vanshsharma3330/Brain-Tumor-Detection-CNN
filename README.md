# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into four categories:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

The model is trained using deep learning techniques and evaluated on unseen MRI images to assist in automated brain tumor detection.

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a combination of:
- Figshare Brain Tumor Dataset
- SARTAJ dataset
- Br35H dataset (used for No Tumor class)

The final dataset contains **7023 MRI images** categorized into four classes.
